# Description
This Addon simply adds a still growing collection of rations to [Hideous Destructor](https://codeberg.org/mc776/HideousDestructor). 

The quality of those rations ranges from amazing to Nacho cheese without the nachos, all the way down to bags of cat treats.

This pack should work fine alongside other ration packs.
